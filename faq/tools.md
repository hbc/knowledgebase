# HBC tools

This document is a guide on how to find information about software tools that have been incorporated into the bcbio pipeline, tools that we have tested, but not incorporated, and tools that we would like to test.

## bcbio-incorporated tools

Information about the tools used as part of bcbio is available [here](../../computing/bcbio/tools_incorporated.md).

## All tools incorporated, tested or planning to test

Information about all of the tools that we either use, have tested, or would like to test are available within the `knowledgebase/research/[NGS_method]/tools.md`.

The `tools.md` document should have two sections, with one section for tools that have been tested, `Tools_tested` and another section for tools that we would like to explore, `Tools_novel`. A template for the `tools.md` document is available [here](https://github.com/hbc/knowledgebase/tree/master/research/template).
