# ChIP-seq

The ChIP-seq pipeline is very similar to ATAC-seq. The following steps are taken with bcbio:

* Evaluates data quality using FASTQC and filters and trims reads as necessary.
* Reads are aligned to the genome and only uniquely aligning reads are retained (duplicates and multi-mappers are removed).
* Peaks are called from the cleaned up BAM files.
* Bigwig (.bw) files are generated for the filtered BAM files.
* Consensus peaks are created by choosing the peak with the highest score when peaks overlap, described more in depth in the [bedops documentation](https://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/usage-examples/master-list.html).
* A matrix of peak counts is created with featureCounts that can be used with downstream count-based differential expression callers like DESeq2/limma/edgeR.

## Description of example dataset

We will be working using ChIP-seq data from a recent publication in Neuron by Baizabal et al. (2018) [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.04.033). 
Baizabal et al. sought to understand how chromatin-modifying enzymes function in neural stem cells to establish the epigenetic landscape that determines cell type and stage-specific gene expression. Chromatin-modifying enzymes are transcriptional regulators that control gene expression through covalent modification of DNA or histones. 

This specific dataset focuses on the transcriptional regulator **PRDM16, which is a chromatin-modifying enzyme** that belongs to the larger PRDM (Positive Regulatory Domain) protein family, that is structurally defined by the **presence of a conserved N-terminal histone methyltransferase PR domain** ([Hohenauer and Moore, 2012](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/139/13/2267/45169/The-Prdm-family-expanding-roles-in-stem-cells-and)). The authors generated ChIP-seq data for PRDM16. Our dataset consists of two WT samples and two KO samples.


### 1. Download the example data and configuration files
This downloads the input data, creates the project structure and example configuration files.

#### 1.1 Create input directory and download FASTQ files.

To download the files used in this experiment, you will need to use the SRA Toolkit. Once installed, you can use the following commands:

```bash
mkdir chip-example
cd chip-example
mkdir -p fastq

fastq-dump --accession SRR6823763
cat SRR6823762.fastq SRR6823763.fastq | gzip > wt_sample1_chip.fastq.gz
rm SRR6823762.fastq SRR6823763.fastq

# For WT Sample 1 Input
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823764
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823765
cat SRR6823764.fastq SRR6823765.fastq | gzip > wt_sample1_input.fastq.gz

# For WT Sample 2 Input
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823768
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823769
cat SRR6823768.fastq SRR6823769.fastq | gzip > wt_sample2_input.fastq.gz
rm SRR6823768.fastq SRR6823769.fastq

# For KO Sample 1 ChIP
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823770
cat SRR6823770.fastq | gzip > ko_sample1_chip.fastq.gz
rm SRR6823770.fastq

# For KO Sample 1 Input
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823771
cat SRR6823771.fastq | gzip > ko_sample1_input.fastq.gz
rm SRR6823771.fastq

# For KO Sample 2 ChIP                                                                    
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823772
cat SRR6823772.fastq | gzip > ko_sample2_chip.fastq.gz
rm SRR6823772.fastq

# For KO Sample 2 Input
fastq-dump --accession SRR6823773
cat SRR6823773.fastq | gzip > ko_sample2_input.fastq.gz
rm SRR6823773.fastq
```

#### 1.2 Create the template YAML file describing the ChIP-seq analysis

Create a metadata directory for your yaml and samplesheet.

```bash
mkdir -p metadata
```

Create the `chip-example.yaml` file inside the `metadata` folder and then copy/paste in the example text below.

chip-example.yaml: 

```yaml
details:
- analysis: chip-seq
  genome_build: mm10
  algorithm:
    aligner: bowtie2
    adapters: illumina
    trim_reads: read_through
    peakcaller: macs2
    chip_method: chip
    keep_duplicates: False
    keep_multimapped: False
upload:
  dir: ../final
```

Here we are telling bcbio that we want our reads trimmed (trim_reads: read_through) rather then letting bcbio decide.

#### 1.3 Create a sample sheet

Create the sample sheet file `neurons.csv` inside the `metadata` folder, then copy/paste in the example text below.

neurons.csv:

```
samplename,description,genotype,enzyme,batch,phenotype,antibody
ko_sample1_chip.fastq.gz,ko_sample1_chip,KO,PRDM19,pair1,chip,narrow
ko_sample1_input.fastq.gz,ko_sample1_input,KO,INPUT,pair1,input,narrow
ko_sample2_chip.fastq.gz,ko_sample2_chip,KO,PRDM19,pair2,chip,narrow
ko_sample2_input.fastq.gz,ko_sample2_input,KO,INPUT,pair2,input,narrow
wt_sample1_chip.fastq.gz,wt_sample1_chip,WT,PRDM19,pair3,chip,narrow
wt_sample1_input.fastq.gz,wt_sample1_input,WT,INPUT,pair3,input,narrow
wt_sample2_chip.fastq.gz,wt_sample2_chip,WT,PRDM19,pair4,chip,narrow
wt_sample2_input.fastq.gz,wt_sample2_input,WT,INPUT,pair4,input,narrow
```

The necessary columns here are: `samplename`, `description`, `batch`, `phenotype` and `antibody`. The following three are unique to ChIP-seq analysis:

* `phenotype` column tells bcbio if a sample is an input or chip.
* `batch` matches your input samples with their respective chips.
* `antibody` specifies the target histone modification which ultimately translates to narrow or broad peak calling. More information can be found below.

#### 1.3.1 The batch column 
In our example dataset we have one input for every chip. For example ko_sample1_chip has a corresponding ko_sample1_input. As such in the 'batch` column, each has the value **pair1**. However, **sometimes the same input is used for multiple chips**. In this case you will need to list mutiple pair values in `batch` column for the input sample. Below is a metadata example for the case where two chips were performed on ko_sample1 (one for Prdm16 and one for H3K4me1) but only a single input was generated:


```
####DO NOT USE - EXAMPLE ONLY####

samplename,description,genotype,enzyme,batch,phenotype,antibody
ko_sample1_chip_prdm16.fastq.gz,ko_sample1_chip_prdm,KO,PRDM19,pair1,chip,narrow
ko_sample1_chip_h3k4me.fastq.gz,ko_sample1_chip_h3k4,KO,H3K4Me1,pair2,chip,narrow
ko_sample1_input.fastq.gz,ko_sample1_input,KO,INPUT,pair1;pair2,input,narrow
```

We have changed file names and descriptions because bcbio does not allow for duplicates. **Each chip must have its own pair value**. Input files can match as many chips as needed and the pair names should be separated by `;`.


#### 1.3.2 The antibody column 

The `antibody` column tells bcbio whether to call broad or narrow peaks on the data. If you are a beginner we suggest just using broad or narrow in this column and adding your chip in a separate metadata column (e.g., "enzyme" above). 

As a guide, we provide some common broad and narrow antibodies here.

Broad antibodies:

    'h3f3a', 'h3k27me3', 'h3k36me3', 'h3k4me1', 'h3k79me2', 'h3k79me3', 'h3k9me1', 'h3k9me2', 'h4k20me1', 'h3k9me3'

Narrow antibodies:

    'h2afz', 'h3ac', 'h3k27ac', 'h3k4me2', 'h3k4me3', 'h3k9ac'


If you are not sure which to use, it is best to begin with narrow.

Alternatively, you can directly specify the histone modification (values above) in the `antibody` colum and bcbio will correctly assign broad or narrow peaks. If you are using a different antibody you MUST add the broad or narrow value. **If bcbio does not have a value in the `antibody` column narrow peaks will be called.**


### 2. Generate YAML config file for analysis

```bash
bcbio_nextgen.py -w template metadata/chip-example.yaml metadata/neurons.csv fastq
```

You should see a folder structure:
```
neurons
|---config
|---work
```

_The `final` folder will get created here once the bcbio run is complete._


`chip-example/config/neurons.yaml` is the main config file to run the bcbio project. You will
see this file has a copy of the parameters in `chip-example.yaml` for each sample.

### 3. Run the analysis
This will run the analysis on a local machine, using 16 cores.

```bash
cd neurons/work
bcbio_nextgen.py ../config/neurons.yaml -n 16
```

## Parameters

* `peakcaller`: `[macs2]` bcbio just supports MACS2
* `aligner`: supports `bowtie2` and `bwa`. `bwa` will result in a superset of the peaks called by `bowtie2`.
* `keep_duplicates`: do not remove duplicates before peak calling. Defaults to _False_.
* `keep_multimapped`: do not remove multimappers before peak calling. Defaults to _False_.

## Downstream analysis

### Quality Control

**MultiQC**

It is hard to give specific cutoffs of metrics to use since the kit, the sample
material, the organism, the genome annotations and so on all affect all of the
metrics. We generally look at the samples as a whole for an experiment and see
if any of the samples are outliers in the important metrics. In the **MultiQC**
report, we look speicifically at:

* the percentage of reads in the peaks
* the mapping percentage
* the [ENCODE library complexity statistics](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/)
* the FastQC metrics

**NOTE:** The stats in the `multiqc_report.html` is generated based on alignments pre-filtering. **The input BAM files include all reads (duplicated, multimappers)**.

### Differential affinity analysis

For doing differential affinity analysis we recommend using
[DiffBind](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DiffBind.html). 
The DiffBind tutorials are great for understanding how to go about with your downstream analyses.
